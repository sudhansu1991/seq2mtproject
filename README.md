# PhD Sequence Modeling Experiments

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks from my previous PhD work on sequence modeling.  
The code is experimental, but it documents important steps and ideas I explored.

## Contents
- `seq2.ipynb` – main notebook with sequence modeling experiments

## About
These notebooks reflect earlier research and may not represent my current work.  
I’m archiving them here for reference and to share methods with others who may find them useful.

## How to Use
Clone the repository and open the notebook in Jupyter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudhansu1991/phd-seq-experiments.git
cd phd-seq-experiments
jupyter notebook seq2.ipynb
